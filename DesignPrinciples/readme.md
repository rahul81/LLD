Software development is a complex field that requires careful planning and design to ensure that applications are maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. One of the foundational guidelines for achieving these goals is the set of SOLID principles. 🛠️📊

‍

SOLID principles are five essential guidelines that enhance software design, making code more maintainable and scalable. They include:

1. Single Responsibility Principle 🔑

2. Open/Closed Principle 🔓

3. Liskov Substitution Principle 🔄

4. Interface Segregation Principle 📏

5. Dependency Inversion Principle 🔗


Need for SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design:
Below are some of the main reasons why SOLID principles are important in object-oriented design:

• Scalability: Adding new features becomes straightforward. 📈

• Maintainability: Changes in one part of the system have minimal impact on others. 🔄

• Testability: Decoupled designs make unit testing easier. 🧪

• Readability: Clear separation of concerns improves code comprehension. 📚
