/* Aggregation: Grouping with a Twist
Aggregation is a specialized form of association that represents a "has-a" relationship where the parts can exist independently of the wholeâ€”but they are grouped together by a container.
Think of a Team and its Players: a team has players, yet the players can exist even if the team is disbanded.
