synchronized:

• The synchronized keyword is built into the language; it automatically acquires and releases the intrinsic lock (monitor) of an object. 🔄

• It is simple to use but offers only blocking behavior—it always waits indefinitely to acquire the lock. ⏳

• You cannot try to acquire a synchronized lock with a timeout or check if the lock is available (i.e., no non‑blocking acquisition). ❌

‍

ReentrantLock:

• Part of the java.util.concurrent.lockspackage, ReentrantLock provides explicit lock management. 🛠️

• It gives you extra flexibility—for instance, with methods such as tryLock()(with or without a timeout) you can attempt to acquire the lock in a non‑blocking manner. ⏱️

• It also supports interruptible lock acquisition (lockInterruptibly()) and fairness policies. ⚖️

2. Automatic vs. Manual Release: 🔄🆚👐

• synchronized:

• The lock is automatically released when the synchronized block or method exits (even if an exception occurs). 🔄

• ReentrantLock:

• You must explicitly call unlock()(usually in a finallyblock) to ensure that the lock is released. This gives you additional control but also adds responsibility. 🔑
